# Driver Drowsiness Detection

A real-time driver drowsiness detection system that uses computer vision techniques to monitor and detect signs of drowsiness in drivers, aiming to enhance road safety and prevent accidents.

## Features

- **Eye and Face Detection**: Utilizes OpenCV and machine learning models to detect facial landmarks.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Processes live video feed to monitor the driver continuously.
- **Alert System**: Triggers alerts when signs of drowsiness are detected.
- **Performance Optimization**: Ensures efficient processing for real-time detection.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: OpenCV, Dlib, NumPy
- **Tools**: Pre-trained facial landmark models

## Installation
